# Levelset
We proposed a advance and new algorithm about Level Set implementation in this paper "Xuchu Wang, Jinxiao Shan, Yanmin Niu, Liwen Tan, Shao-Xiang Zhang,Enhanced distance regularization for re-initialization free level set evolution with application to image segmentation,Neurocomputing,Volume 141,2014,Pages 223-235".
This article won the title of high-level thesis of Chongqing Universityï¼Œand included bySCI.This project codes implement our theory from the paper.
